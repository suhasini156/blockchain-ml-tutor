BLOCKCHAIN BASICS:
1. Blockchain is a decentralized ledger of all transactions across a peer-to-peer network.
2. Each block contains data, hash of the block, and hash of the previous block.
3. It ensures security, transparency, and immutability.
BLOCK STRUCTURE:
- Data: Contains transaction details
- Hash: Unique fingerprint of the block
- Previous Hash: Links block to the previous one
TYPES OF BLOCKCHAIN:
1. Public Blockchain – Anyone can join (e.g., Bitcoin)
2. Private Blockchain – Restricted access (e.g., Hyperledger)
3. Consortium Blockchain – Controlled by a group (e.g., banks)
USE CASES:
- Cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, Ethereum)
- Healthcare (secure patient records)
- Supply Chain (track goods)
- Education (verifying certificates)
