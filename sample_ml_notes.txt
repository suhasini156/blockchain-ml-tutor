MACHINE LEARNING BASICS:
1. Machine Learning (ML) allows systems to learn from data.
TYPES:
- Supervised (e.g., classification)
- Unsupervised (e.g., clustering)
- Reinforcement (e.g., Q-learning)
KEY TERMS:
- Overfitting: model too complex
- Underfitting: model too simple
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall
